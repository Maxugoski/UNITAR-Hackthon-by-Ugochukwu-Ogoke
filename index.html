							<h2>Introducing
							<br />
							a groundbreaking hackathon solution that revolutionalizes Employment and livelihood Development for Women, Children and Young people</h2>
							<p>I am Ugochukwu Ogoke, a Web developer, Graphics designer, and philosopher. But my true calling lies in my work with Women's Aid Collective (WACOL). The stories I encounter in my role as a member of this organization are both heartbreaking and inspiring.

I reside in the vibrant city of Enugu in Nigeria, a place that holds a special place in my heart. Enugu, the largest city in southeastern Nigeria, serves as the capital of Enugu State. It is a city teeming with life, but it also bears witness to the dark reality of gender-based violence.

Within Enugu and the other southeastern states of Nigeria, WACOL receives an overwhelming number of cases each year. On average, we handle 1,000 to 2,000 cases of gender-based violence. Shockingly, Enugu alone accounts for 62% of these reported cases.

These cases primarily involve women trapped in abusive marriages. They endure unimaginable pain, yet often find themselves unable to break free from their abusers. Why, you may ask? The answer lies in a complex web of dependency and fear. Many of these women rely on their husbands for everything, and without their support, they fear they won't be able to cope.

It is deeply disheartening to witness how these vulnerable women are taken advantage of by their abusers. The perpetrators see them as helpless and jobless, exploiting their dire circumstances for their own gain.

							<p>One particular story haunts my thoughts. Let me share the tale of Mrs. Felicia, a pseudonym to protect her identity. She was a newly married woman, filled with hopes and dreams for a blissful future with her husband, a hardworking welder. They cherished each other and worked tirelessly to build a home together, like any dedicated Nigerian couple.

But fate dealt a cruel hand when her husband passed away unexpectedly. Mrs. Felicia's world crumbled around her, and her dreams shattered. How would she survive without her beloved husband, upon whom she relied for her livelihood? The only solace she could find was in the assets and investments left by her late husband.

However, her hopes were dashed by her greedy and heartless brother-in-laws. They swooped in like vultures, seizing all the possessions and properties that rightfully belonged to her. To add insult to injury, they taunted her, belittling her poverty and claiming she was powerless to seek justice. They believed she was too destitute to afford legal representation or ask for help.

Thankfully, Mrs. Felicia found her way to WACOL. When she shared her heart-wrenching story with us, we were deeply moved. We vowed to fight for her until justice was served for this poor widow. We wasted no time in writing letters to the community leaders, urging them to take immediate action and recover all the properties that were rightfully hers.

Through our unwavering efforts, we were able to reclaim every single possession and property that had been wrongfully taken. Mrs. Felicia could finally stand on her own two feet once again, with renewed strength and hope.

The triumph of Mrs. Felicia's story serves as a powerful reminder of why we do what we do at WACOL. It is not just about fighting for justice; it is about restoring dignity and empowering those who have been silenced and oppressed. We are committed to creating a world where no woman has to endure such pain and injustice alone.

As I reflect on this journey, my heart swells with a mixture of sadness, anger, and hope. The battle against gender-based violence is far from over, but as long as there are stories like Mrs. Felicia's, we will continue to fight with all our might. May justice prevail and bring a glimmer of light to the lives of those who have been unjustly silenced.
Cases like this have inspired us to develop a solution aimed at training and empowering women, especially survivors of gender-based violence, to ensure their employability.

The intention behind this initiative is to provide these women with the necessary skills and resources they need to secure employment opportunities. We believe that by equipping them with the right training, they can overcome the challenges they face and build a brighter future for themselves.

								<h3>Statistics of Unemployed Women in Enugu</h3>
								<p>A Dataphyte review of Nigeria’s unemployment data between Q3 2018 and the recent Q4 2020, has shown that about four in every ten persons in the South Eastern part of Nigeria are unemployed, about 31.6% unemployment rate in Enugu state and majority are women. This makes unemployed women more vulnerable to Domestic Violence in Enugu.</p>
